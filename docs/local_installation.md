## Local installation

We recommend you use a virtual environment to set up RecordTrac locally. More details can be found in [this howto](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Python-Virtualenv.md).


This application requires [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). For help getting started with PostgreSQL and creating a database, you can refer to [this howto](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/PostgreSQL.md). Name your database 'recordtrac'.

Inside your virtual environment:

    git clone git://github.com/postcode/recordtrac.git
    cd recordtrac
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Save .env.example as .env, and update relevant fields in .env.

### Run locally

If creating the database for the first time, run:

    foreman run python db_setup.py

To seed the application with user data, requests and responses, run:

    foreman run python db_users.py
    foreman run python db_seed.py

To use the application locally, run:

    foreman start


You should see something similar to:

    2013-05-06 12:16:53 [1776] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 0.17.4
    2013-05-06 12:16:53 [1776] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (1776)

Navigate to the url (in this case, http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.
