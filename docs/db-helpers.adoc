== Intro

The functionality of the database can be found in the `db_helpers.py` file.

This searches the database for an object via its class/type (defined in the
`models.py` file) and ID and returns the object:

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['get_obj'] }}

This searches the database for all objects of a certain class/type (defined in
the "models.py" file) and returns a queryset.

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['get_objs'] }}</p>

Retrieves a request associated with a particular owner:

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['get_request_by_owner'] }}

A user can be associated with multiple owners. Gets owner by their user ID:

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['get_owners_by_user_id'] }}

Retrieves requests based on filters provided:

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['get_requests_by_filters'] }}

== Adding Records

Adds a particular object to the database:

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['put_obj'] }}

Obtain the object its ID and type, if the object is not provided, and updates
the specified attribute for that object. If the command is successful, returns
the word 'true.':

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['update_obj'] }}
 
Gets an object by its ID and type to return the specified attribute for that
object, if the object is not provided:

{{ d['/public_records_portal/db_helpers.py|idio|asciisyn']['get_attribute'] }}
