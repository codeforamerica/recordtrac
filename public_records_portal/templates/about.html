				<h3>What Is RecordTrac?</h3>
			<p>RecordTrac is a quick, simple way for you to submit a public records request to the City of Oakland.</p>  
			<p><strong>Every message or record uploaded on this site is completely public.</strong> This makes easier to understand what happens to every request. You can also search through past records requests and view previously released documents.</p>
				<h3 id="why">Why Was RecordTrac Made?</h3>

				<p>The 2013 Code for America fellows created RecordTrac with the City of Oakland. As public records requests became larger and more complex, city employees found coordinating a response to be difficult. The old software system no longer met their needs and most requests remained untracked.</p>
				<p>Members of the public complained they didn’t understand what happened after they submitted their requests and it took too long to get the records they needed.</p>
				<p>By making everything completely transparent, you can know what happens to each request.</p>


				<h3 id="why">Why Can You Show Everyone My Request?</h3>
				<p>The California Public Records Act and Oakland’s Sunshine Ordinance gives everyone access to documents, photos, emails, texts, audio recordings, and data about the City and its business. This is why we can display your request and any responses from city staff. To make you feel comfortable, we don't allow the public to view your name or contact information through this website. </p>

				<p>According to the Public Records Act, the City must:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Help you locate the record</li>
				<li>Allow you to view the records immediately during business hours</li>
				<li>Respond within 10 days</li> 
				</ul>
				<p>The City may ask for a 14-day extension if they have to sort through a large number of documents, retrieve the document from a facility outside of City Hall, consult with another agency, or write a computer program to get data.</p>
