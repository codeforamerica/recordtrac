				<h4 id="what">What is RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>RecordTrac is a quick, simple way for you to submit a public records request to {{config['AGENCY_NAME']}}</p>  
				<p><strong>Every message or record uploaded on this site is completely public.</strong> This makes easier to understand what happens to every request.</p>
				<br>

				<h4 id="why">Why was RecordTrac made?</h4>

				<p>The 2013 Code for America fellows created RecordTrac with the City of Oakland. As public records requests became larger and more complex, city employees found coordinating a response to be difficult. The old software system no longer met their needs and many requests remained untracked.</p>
				<p>Members of the public complained they didn’t understand what happened after they submitted their requests and it took too long to get the records they needed.</p>
				<p>By making everything completely transparent, you can know your request is fulfilled.</p>
				<br>


				<h4 id="all request table">Where can I find all the requests submitted through RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>RecordTrac displays all current and past records requests at <a href="http://records.oaklandnet.com/requests">records.oaklandnet.com/requests</a>. A description of what RecordTrac displays on this page can be found below:</p>

				<h4 id="show">Why can you show everyone my request?</h4>
				<p>The California Public Records Act and Oakland’s Sunshine Ordinance gives everyone access to documents, photos, emails, texts, audio recordings, and data about the City and its business. This is why we can display your request and any responses from city staff. To make you feel comfortable, we don't allow the public to view your name or contact information through this website. </p>

				<p>According to the Public Records Act, the City must:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Help you locate the record</li>
				<li>Allow you to view the records immediately during business hours</li>
				<li>Respond within 10 days</li> 
				</ul>
				<p>The City may ask for a 14-day extension if they have to sort through a large number of documents, retrieve the document from a facility outside of City Hall, consult with another agency, or write a computer program to get data.</p> 
				<p>
					For more information on the Public Records Act and the Sunshine Ordinance, check out these resources:

					<li><a href="http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/resources/PubInfoRequest.html">City Attorney's website</a></li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h4 id="documents">Why aren't all documents uploaded on RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>The City of Oakland will not publicly release records or information that violates your right to privacy. This also includes records that will compromise your safety or the completion of a law enforcement investigation.</p>

				<p>Many police reports contain sensitive information that can only be sent to the individuals directly involved in the crime or incident. The Oakland Police Department (OPD) will not release these types of reports through RecordTrac. You will, however, better understand the number and types of records requests processed by OPD.</p>   
				<br>
				<h4 id="redeploy">What should I do if I want my city to use RecordTrac?</h4>
				<p>RecordTrac is an open-source software project that can be redeployed by any municipality. If you want to reuse RecordTrac, we'd love to hear from you. Visit our sign-up page by <a href="http://records.oaklandnet.com/signup">clicking here</a>.</p>
