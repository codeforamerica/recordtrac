public-records
==============

This is a portal to display public record requests to the community and the City of Oakland.


## Installation

This application requires [Postgres](http://www.postgresapp.com/) and Xcode developer tools to be installed.

    /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/psql
    CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;

If you are using a standard Postgres installation or from [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) you can also use:

        createdb publicrecords

In a new window:

    git clone git://github.com/codeforamerica/public-records.git
    cd public-records
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    mkdir uploads

Save example-settings.cfg as settings.cfg and update relevant fields.

## Run locally

To use the application locally, in a new window:

    python prflask.py
